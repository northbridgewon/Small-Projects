# My Programming Sandbox

This repository is a collection of various small projects, coding exercises, and examples written in several programming languages. It serves as a personal sandbox for experimenting with different technologies and practicing software development concepts.

## Structure

The projects are primarily organized into top-level directories named after the programming language they use:

*   `go/` - Go projects
*   `java/` - Java projects
*   `js/` - JavaScript projects
*   `rust/` - Rust projects

Each language directory may contain multiple independent sub-projects.

## Projects Overview

Here's a brief overview of the types of projects you can find in each language directory:

*   **Go:** Command-line utilities and small applications, including a calculator, a quiz game, a web page downloader, a Unix time string generator, and more.
*   **Java:** Standalone applications such as a Library Management System, a Quiz application, a Stock Price Analyzer, and a Student Management System.
*   **JavaScript:** Frontend examples including a calculator, a task list application, and a timer.
*   **Rust:** Basic examples like a "Hello, World!" program and a simple math operations utility.

## How to Use

1.  **Navigate to a project:** Browse the language directories (`go/`, `java/`, etc.) and then into the specific sub-project directory you are interested in.
2.  **Look for specific instructions:** Some projects may have their own `README.md` files (e.g., `go/quiz/README.md`) with more detailed instructions on how to build, run, or use them.
3.  **Language-specific execution:**
    *   **Go, Java, Rust:** These projects typically require compilation. You'll need the respective language's SDK/compiler installed (Go, JDK, Rustc/Cargo). Look for `main` functions or build scripts.
    *   **JavaScript:** These are often frontend projects that can be run in a web browser, sometimes requiring a local web server for certain functionalities. Node.js might be needed for some command-line JavaScript projects or build tools.
